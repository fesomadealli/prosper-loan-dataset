# prosper-loan-dataset
Third project of Udacity ALX nanodegree.
Main action was to create exploratory visualizations that help reveal insights on the dataset and some of these visuals were extracted from the set of visualizations to complete the explanatory visualization phase where the insights wer communicated to stakeholder.
Explanatory visualizations featured a minimum of 15 visualizations and the explanatory visuals have not more than 50% of that.
Finally, a slide deck was created and all files used in the project documented and organized for submission according to the project rubric.
