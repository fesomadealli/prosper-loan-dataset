## Dataset

> The dataset has 113,937 rows and 81 columns


## Summary of Findings

> Commonest loan period is 36 months

> Most values still seem to distribute around the left and between .1 and .2 however, the peak changes when the bins are adjusted

> Most applicants have their income between $25,000k and $74,999k

> Most applicants have a way of verifying their income

> First thing observed is the completed loans have a relatively lower BorrowerRate with a decent amount of outliers. Those who are also in line of making final payment also have their median rates not so far from the .2 mark

> Clearly majority fancies 36 months irrespective of income range and also those earning between IncomeRanges of $25k -$75k are most involved in such. I think it's because they're the most common set of loan applicants and the median rate is fairly around the .2 margin

> Most people who have completed their loan payments earn between 25k-49,999k USD. Those who currently have loans they are serving earn 50k-74,999k USD



## Key Insights for Presentation

> Majority of the applicants aren't neccessarily collar-job officers. Students are among those who get the least loan approvals and I'd argue it's because they likely make no income for a refund. With all the categories and their low count, I'd say the major part of the "Others" are likely to  be business oriented personnels/bodies.

> Most beneficiaries are employed but less than half have full time employments and even way lesser are self-employed. This could likely correspond with my assumption of business oriented personnels because, if someone works a job part time, they likely need funds for their side-hustles/other business to look after families and mortgages and all. Plus, having a means of employment is a strong criteria for obtaining loans as one would likely ssume due to the need for a refund with interest

> Well there are almost as many Non Home Owners are there are Home Owners so the idea of a collateral is quickly downtrodden. I presume it wont be a strong criteria

> The common/median salary range happen to appear on the rightmost parts where the highest rates are with the low earners of the median range having the most people. The higher percentage of those with the lower rates are often found with high income earners.
